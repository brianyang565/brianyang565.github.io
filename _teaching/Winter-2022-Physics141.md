Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the first course in the Elementary Laboratory sequence. This course covers principles of classical mechanics. Students perform data analysis using Python on Jupyter notebook. I led two sections (2 hours each), where students worked in small groups on worksheets covering problems related to the topics covered in class. I provided a short introduction to the topics on the worksheet, helped individual groups with questions, and then went over the solutions to the worksheet problems at the end of the section. I also graded the submitted worksheets, as well as multiple choice questions on weekly quizzes.
