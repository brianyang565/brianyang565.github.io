Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for 1 sections of a senior-level modern physics lab in Winter 2025. I assisted the professor with helping groups of 2 students work through four experiments in modern physics. I also assisted the professor in reviewing and commenting draft reports submitted by student groups.
