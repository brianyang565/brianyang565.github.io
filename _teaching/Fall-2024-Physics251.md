Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for the second course in the introductory Physics for the Life Sciences Laboratory sequence. This course covers principles of electricity and magnetism, including light and wave phenomena. I led two sections (2 hours each), where students worked in small groups on worksheets covering problems related to the topics covered in class. I provided a short introduction to the topics on the worksheet, helped individual groups with questions, and then went over the solutions to the worksheet problems at the end of the section. I also graded the submitted worksheets, as well as multiple choice questions on weekly quizzes.
