Atom-light entanglement is a key concept in quantum information science. Within a Rydberg atom system, the interaction-induced dephasing is often used to produce entangled states within atomic ensembles. Here, we present a theoretical model and experimental results for the temporal evolution of an initially unentangled Rydberg spin wave into an entangled Dicke state and study effects of interference between non-classical light retrieved from the atoms and a coherent probe field. These results should be useful for a range of quantum information protocols including single photon generation and atom-light entanglement preparation.
