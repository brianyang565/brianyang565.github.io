Collective qubits between atomic ground and Rydberg states can be converted, on-demand, into single photons, making them well-suited for scalable quantum network-type protocols. We demonstrate long-lived many-body Rabi oscillations and multi-particle entanglement, as well as study the dynamics of interaction-induced dephasing for collective Rydberg qubits held in a state-insensitive optical lattice trap. Both excitation blockade and spin-wave dephasing can contribute to suppression of multiple excitations, allowing for deterministic preparation of collective atomic qubits, single photons, and atom-photon entanglement for quantum information processing.
